server in server folder, front-end in dsy folder
run server by using command `npm run dev` while in server folder, default port is 5050
run front-end by using command `npm start` while in dsy folder, default port is 3000

app is still not done btw

idea:
- create back-end that can: handle calls for login to check credentials from database, get objects' information from storage, copy, upload, delete, and download objects.
- create react front-end
- create a mongoDB database for user's credentials and Azure blob storages for storing items.
